        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <article id="bio">
          <p>Originally from Northbrook, IL, I've always had a love for problem-solving. I graduated from The University of Chicago in June 2019 with a B.S. in Molecular Engineering, Chemical and Soft Materials Track, and I received my M.S. in Macromolecular Science and Engineering from the University of Michigan in December 2021. However, I also wanted to explore computer programming as a career, as I had been exposed to it in undergrad and found it intellectualy stimulating. In my free time, I enjoy writing and playing music, video games, and learning about science, creative media, and politics.</p>
          <br>
          <p>In addition to my knowledge of Python from undergraduate classwork, I am self-studied in a variety of programming and markup languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, C#, and more.</p>
